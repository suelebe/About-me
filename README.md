# About-me
As a Human Resources Professional, I have become aware that the market is pushing us to assume a more active role to help companies "being digital" and not just "doing digital".  I consider myself a HR Professional passionately devoted to talent management and talent acquisition, with a wide experience in IT companies. I thrive in a collaborative workplace and feel comfortable handling cultural challenges.  With innovation in mind, I seek to streamline human resources processes and policies, re-thinking new methods and adapting current practices to different environments, using all of the organizational tools to foster changes.  I greatly enjoy my work. I believe in the quality of our own actions and that continuous improvement raises the bar and takes people and processes to the next level.
